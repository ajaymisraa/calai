He's probably the last person on\nearth you would ever look to for life advice or expect to see\nin any sort of self-help book.\n\nWhich is why he’s the perfect place to start.\n\nBukowski wanted to be a writer. But for decades his\nwork was rejected by almost every magazine, newspaper,\njournal, agent, and publisher he submitted to. His work\nwas horrible, they said. Crude. Disgusting, Depraved. And\nas the stacks of rejection slips piled up, the weight of his\nfailures pushed him deep into an alcohol-fueled\ndepression that would follow him for most of his life.\n\nBukowski had a day job as a letter-filer at a post office.\nHe got paid shit money and spent most of it on booze. He\ngambled away the rest at the racetrack. At night, he would\ndrink alone and sometimes hammer out poetry on his\nbeat-up old typewriter. Often, he'd wake up on the floor,\nhaving passed out the night before.\n\nThirty years went by like this, most of it a meaningless\nblur of alcohol, drugs, gambling, and prostitutes. Then,\nwhen Bukowski was fifty, after a lifetime of failure and\nself-loathing, an editor at a small independent publishing\nhouse took a strange interest in him. The editor couldn't\noffer Bukowski much money or much promise of sales. But\nhe had a weird affection for the drunk loser, so he decided\nto take a chance on him. It was the first real shot Bukowski\nhad ever gotten, and, he realized, probably the only one he\nwould ever get. Bukowski wrote back to the editor: “I have\none of two choices—stay in the post office and go crazy ...\nor stay out here and play at writer and starve. I have\n\n-“P",

In\nthe dedication, he wrote, “Dedicated to nobody.”\n\nBukowski would make it as a novelist and poet. He\n‘would go on and publish six novels and hundreds of\npoems, selling over two million copies of his books. His\npopularity defied everyone's expectations, particularly his\nown.\n\nStories like Bukowski’s are the bread and butter of our\ncultural narrative. Bukowski’s life embodies the American\nDream: a man fights for what he wants, never gives up,\nand eventually achieves his wildest dreams. It’s practically\na movie waiting to happen. We all look at stories like\nBukowski’s and say, “See? He never gave up. He never\nstopped trying. He always believed in himself. He\npersisted against all the odds and made something of\nhimself!”\n\nIt is then strange that on Bukowski’s tombstone, the\nepitaph reads: “Don’t try.”\n\nSee, despite the book sales and the fame, Bukowski was\na loser. He knew it. And his success stemmed not from\nsome determination to be a winner, but from the fact that\nhe knew he was a loser, accepted it, and then wrote\nhonestly about it. He never tried to be anything other than\n‘what he was. The genius in Bukowski’s work was not in\novercoming unbelievable odds or developing himself into a\nshining literary light. It was the opposite. It was his simple\nability to be completely, unflinchingly honest with himself\n—especially the worst parts of himself—and to share his\nfailings without hesitation or doubt.\n\nThis is the real story of Bukowski’ success: his comfort\nwith himself as a failure. Bukowski didn’t give a fuck about\nsuccess. Even after his fame, he still showed up to poetry\nreadings hammered and verbally abused people in his\naudience. He still exposed himself in public and tried to\nsleep with every woman he could find. Fame and success\n\n< 4-5/196 >",

Nor was it by becoming a\nbetter person that he became famous and successful.\n\nSelf-improvement and success often occur together.\nBut that doesn’t necessarily mean they're the same thing.\n\nOur culture today is obsessively focused on\nunrealistically positive expectations: Be happier. Be\nhealthier. Be the best, better than the rest. Be smarter,\nfaster, richer, sexier, more popular, more productive, more\nenvied, and more admired. Be perfect and amazing and\ncrap out twelve-karat-gold nuggets before breakfast each\n‘morning while Kissing your selfie-ready spouse and two\nand a half kids goodbye. Then fly your helicopter to your\nwonderfully fulfilling job, where you spend your days\ndoing incredibly meaningful work that’s likely to save the\nplanet one day.\n\nBut when you stop and really think about it,\nconventional life advice—all the positive and happy self-\nhelp stuff we hear all the time—is actually fixating on what\nyou lack. Tt lasers in on what you perceive your personal\nshortcomings and failures to already be, and then\nemphasizes them for you. You learn about the best ways to\n‘make money because you feel you don’t have enough\n‘money already. You stand in front of the mirror and repeat\naffirmations saying that you're beautiful because you feel\nas though you're not beautiful already. You follow dating\nand relationship advice because you feel that you're\nunlovable already. You try goofy visualization exercises\nabout being more successful because you feel as though\nyou aren't successful enough already.\n\nIronically, this fixation on the positive—on what's\nbetter, what's superior—only serves to remind us over and\nover again of what we are not, of what we lack, of what we\nshould have been but failed to be. After all, no truly happy\nperson feels the need to stand in front of a mirror and\nrecite that she’s happy. She just is.\n\nThere's a saying in Texas: “The smallest dog barks the\nloudest.” A confident man doesn’t feel a need to prove that\n\n—-",

And if you're dreaming of something all the time, then\nyou're reinforcing the same unconscious reality over and\nover: that you are not that.\n\nEveryone and their TV commercial wants you to\nbelieve that the key to a good life is a nicer job, or a more\nrugged car, or a prettier girlfriend, or a hot tub with an\ninflatable pool for the kids.
